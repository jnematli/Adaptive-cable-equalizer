# Adaptive-cable-equalizer
This project was a part of my Hardware Design course at KU Leuven Campus Group T.

75 Ohm transmission line:

Design rules:

•	The outputs should be symmetrical, the transmission lines at the output should be of the same size.

•	Put components closer to the IC to minimize loop area.

•	Put decoupling capacitors for Vcc to reduce noise.

•	Put transistor to the side of the PCB for the possibility to attach a heat sink.

•	Thermal spacing (already mentioned in the DRC).
